# Two-way-communication-device
The two-way communication channel is a bridge between disabled and normal people. In this paper we propose to make a two-way communication device that leverages various machine learning approaches, employing gesture recognition through capacitive touch sensors,MPU6050, and Raspberry Pi 4B. The device is portable and can establish communication between a disabled user and a normal person by converting the user’s speech to readable text and a disabled person’s gestures to speech.
