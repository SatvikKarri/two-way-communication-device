# Two-Way-Communication-Device
The two-way communication channel is an aid to the differently abled people. The device is portable and can establish communication between a differently abled user and another person by converting the user’s speech to readable text and a person’s gestures to speech. In this project, we propose to make a two-way communication device that leverages various machine learning approaches, employing gesture recognition through capacitive touch sensors,MPU6050, and Raspberry Pi 4B.
